description: Configure LDO model routing — which model runs which role, and when the optional agents fire
---

Walk the operator through LDO's model routing and help them set it for this project.

## How config actually reaches the pipeline

A workflow has no filesystem access — it can't read a config file. Routing reaches it **only** through `args.config` at invocation:

```js
Workflow({ name: "ldo:ldo", args: {
  task: "refactor the auth module",
  config: { models: { medium: { reviewer: "opus" } } }
}})
```

So "configuring LDO" means one of two things:

1. **Per project (the usual way)** — put the routing in the project's `CLAUDE.md`, inside the LDO block that `/ldo-init` writes. Claude reads that every session and passes it on each run.
2. **Per run** — pass `config` inline, as above, to override for one invocation.

`ldo-config.example.json` in the plugin is a reference template of every key with its default. Copy from it; nothing reads it directly.

## The defaults

The protocol exists so different roles can run on different models. The table is flat — the same seven values at every tier — with `opus` planning, coding and threat-modelling, and `sonnet` reviewing. That is deliberate, and it is the reverse of what this table said until recently:

```json
{
  "models": {
    "trivial": { "planner": "opus", "coder": "opus", "reviewer": "sonnet", "reviewerFix": "sonnet", "security": "opus", "researcher": "sonnet", "recorder": "sonnet" },
    "medium":  { "planner": "opus", "coder": "opus", "reviewer": "sonnet", "reviewerFix": "sonnet", "security": "opus", "researcher": "opus",   "recorder": "sonnet" },
    "complex": { "planner": "opus", "coder": "opus", "reviewer": "sonnet", "reviewerFix": "sonnet", "security": "opus", "researcher": "opus",   "recorder": "sonnet" }
  }
}
```

**Planner is fixed because complexity is its own output.** The whole point of `complexity` is to pick a tier — but the Planner produces that rating *by planning*, so nothing can gate the Planner's model on a complexity it hasn't rated yet. Its value comes from surfacing what the task didn't ask about (an unrelated leak, a race nobody flagged, a security gap outside the stated scope) — that kind of judgment doesn't get cheaper because the resulting plan turns out short. Structurally, only the `medium` row's `planner` value is ever read at runtime (Research and Plan both run before complexity is known); the `trivial`/`complex` rows carry the same value purely for shape consistency, not because a different rating would route to a different model.

**The strong model goes where the work is, not where the checking is.** The old argument for the reverse is real and worth stating, because it is what you give up: a cheap model executes narrow instructions well but doesn't reliably know when to stop and ask instead of writing confident, made-up prose about work it didn't verify — a contract line for an event that isn't in the code, a test description contradicting its own body — and a cheap Reviewer is the worst-positioned agent to catch exactly the failure mode it shares.

What outweighed it is arithmetic. A run's cost tracks turns, not agents — 2.4-3.2k output tokens per tool call, stable across five runs of different shape — and turns are set by review rounds. A weak Coder buys rounds; each round is a full Coder *and* Reviewer pass. Opus once is cheaper than Sonnet three times plus three reviews, and the code it writes is what every later pass reasons about. Weeks of daily runs on the inverted table reported plainly better results, which is the evidence this default rests on.

So it is a trade, taken knowingly. `{models: {complex: {reviewer: "opus"}}}` takes it back for the tier where the most is at stake.

**`reviewerFix` routes rounds 2+, and defaults to the same model as `reviewer` on purpose.** A fix pass genuinely is the easier job: round 1 is an open-ended search for defects nobody has named yet, while a fix pass verifies a list the previous round already wrote down. That's a real argument for a cheaper model — but it's a trade, not a free saving, and the measurement says so: in one run, round 4 found a genuine new `major` that rounds 1-3 had missed. So the defaults change nothing, and setting `reviewerFix` yourself is how you buy cheaper fix rounds knowing what they can cost. It stays equal to `reviewer` so lowering one does not silently desynchronise the pair.

**`coder` is `opus` at every tier, and that inverts what this table used to say.** The old shape scaled the Coder with the tier and put the strongest model on the Reviewer. Weeks of daily runs inverted it, and the cost model explains why: a run's cost tracks turns, not agents — 2.4-3.2k output tokens per tool call, stable across five runs — and turns are set by review rounds. A weak Coder buys rounds, and every round is a full Coder *and* Reviewer pass, so Opus once beats Sonnet three times plus three reviews. That said, if a task looks like it wants more than the Coder is giving, narrowing the plan's scope is still usually the better move than reaching for a model: a narrow task is cheaper to review and fails visibly — done or not — where a wide one leaves room to make calls it shouldn't and describe the result confidently.

An override is merged per **role**, not per tier — `{models: {medium: {reviewer: "opus"}}}` changes the medium Reviewer and leaves every other medium role at its default. A tier name, role name, or model value LDO doesn't recognise is warned about in the run log and ignored rather than forwarded: an unusable model name reaching the harness fails with your typo nowhere in the output.

**No `haiku` and no `fable` in the defaults, and neither is a judgment about the model.** `haiku` was the `trivial` Coder and the Recorder until every Haiku sub-agent this project ran failed with `400 clear_thinking_20251015 strategy requires thinking to be enabled` — 6 of 6, against 0 of 47 agents on other models, always on the second request. Nothing about the prompt causes it; the Recorder's input is around 25k of a 200k window. See issue #4. `fable` was the `complex` Reviewer, but it is not on every proxy route, and only the Reviewer has a fallback for a model that isn't there — a Coder routed to a missing model fails the run rather than degrading. So the declared default and the effective one had already drifted apart for anyone without the route. Either model is one `config.models` line away if you have it and want it; neither is something to hand every project by default.

These apply when nothing is passed. The source of truth is `DEFAULT_MODELS` in `workflows/ldo.js` — this table and `ldo-config.example.json` both describe it; if either ever looks stale, that's the one to check against. Model names mean whatever your setup routes them to — the pipeline assumes nothing about which is stronger.

## The roles

Three always run — `reviewerFix` is a fourth routing key, not a fourth agent: it's the same Reviewer, dispatched on rounds 2 and later:

| Role | Does | Model choice |
|------|------|--------------|
| **planner** | Reads the codebase, writes the plan, rates complexity and security surface | Opus at every tier — it can't be gated on the complexity it's the one rating |
| **coder** | Sets up the environment, implements, tests, updates docs | `opus` at every tier — a weak Coder buys review rounds, and a round costs a full Coder and Reviewer pass |
| **reviewer** | Reads the diff *and* drives the app to prove the criteria | `sonnet` at every tier — checking a diff against a named list is the more mechanical half. Raise it per tier if you want the old shape back |
| **reviewerFix** | The same reviewer, on rounds 2+ (the fix passes) | Same model as `reviewer` by default. Lower it to buy cheaper fix rounds — a later round can still find a new blocker, so it's a trade |

Three are conditional:

| Role | Fires when | Model choice |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| **researcher** | `research: true`, or `researchByDefault` — task needs knowledge from outside the repo | Opus at medium/complex — cross-verifying sources is worth it |
| **security** | The Planner rates `security_surface: "elevated"` — new input, auth, secrets, injection, dependency, or crypto surface. Force with `security: true/false` or `securityByDefault` | Opus at every tier — a missed vulnerability costs more than a strong model does |
| **recorder** | Approved, and `complexity != "trivial"` — persists the review report, architecture doc, and backlog so they survive past the session. In a parallel or `isolate: true` run it writes backlog items to `docs/backlog/<label>.md` instead of the shared `docs/BACKLOG.md`, so sibling features never race over the same section numbers | Sonnet at every tier. The work is formatting and filing, not judgment, so Haiku is the right size — but every Haiku sub-agent this project has run died on `400 clear_thinking_20251015 strategy requires thinking to be enabled` (6 of 6, against 0 of 47 on other models), so the Recorder is routed off it as a workaround. See issue #4 |

Starting a project from scratch isn't part of the pipeline — `/ldo-bootstrap` handles that as a conversation, then hands the first task to `/ldo:ldo`.

## Which tier applies

The Planner rates each task `trivial`, `medium`, or `complex`, and that picks the row from `models`. You don't set it — it's assessed per task.

## Cache impact

Anthropic keys its prompt cache on (model, prompt prefix). The Planner's `codebase_context` is the shared prefix for Coder and Reviewer.

- **Same model for both** → the Reviewer hits a warm cache.
- **Different models** → separate cache namespaces, one cold start.

The default accepts that cold start deliberately: an independent read is worth more than the cached tokens. If you're optimising purely for cost on a large codebase, matching the models will save more.

## Other keys

| Key | Default | Effect |
|-----|---------|--------|
| `maxFixLoops` | `3` | How many Code⇄Review rounds before giving up |
| `blockingSeverities` | `["critical","major"]` | Which findings buy another round. Minor and nit ride along in the report |
| `researchByDefault` | `false` | Run the Researcher on every task |
| `securityByDefault` | *(unset)* | Force the Security agent on or off, overriding the Planner's rating |
| `maxParallelFeatures` | `12` | Cap on concurrent features in a multi-feature run (`args.tasks`) — a run above this logs a warning, it isn't blocked |
| `stallMs` | per-role: planner/reviewer `480000`, coder `360000`, security/researcher `300000`, recorder `180000` | How many ms an agent may generate without a tool call before Claude Code aborts it as stalled. Only tool calls reset this timer, so a large structured output (a long plan, a full verdict) needs headroom — a genuinely hung agent costs this value six times over (the harness retries 5 times). Values are milliseconds and must be at least `1000`; anything smaller is rejected with a warning and the default kept, since `480` meaning "eight minutes" would otherwise abort the role instantly, six times over. An unrecognised role name is warned about, not silently ignored |
| `planner.maxStepsPerRun` | `8` | The soft step ceiling handed to the Planner. Above it the Planner is expected to rate `fits_one_run: false` unless the steps are genuinely one unit of work. Not enforced by the orchestrator — nothing is blocked or truncated; an invalid value (non-numeric, or below `1`) is warned about and the default kept |
| `tests.scope` | `"scoped"` | Whether the Coder's baseline/per-step runs and the Reviewer's revert proof run the whole suite or only the touched files. `"scoped"` uses the Planner's `test_command_scoped` template and cuts a run's 5-8 full suite executions to one; `"full"` restores the old behaviour. Scoping only applies when the Planner supplied a template that survives validation — otherwise, and on every resumed plan, the full suite is used unchanged |
| `tests.fullSuiteAt` | `"final-pass"` | Where the one full run belongs: `"final-pass"` at the end of each Coder pass, `"ship"` deferred to `/ldo-ship` before the PR, `"never"` nowhere in the pipeline (you own that gate). On `"ship"` and `"never"` the Coder and the Reviewer each get an explicit do-not-run block on every pass, so the setting removes the run rather than only labelling the result. Only meaningful under `scope: "scoped"` — with `scope: "full"` every run is already the whole suite, so it is neutralised with a log line. The result always carries `full_suite_status` (`ran`/`not_run`/`disabled`/`deferred_to_ship`), and anything but `ran` appends a `FULL SUITE NOT RUN` line to the verdict summary — it annotates, it never blocks |
| `backlog.destination` | `"file"` | Where the Record phase puts backlog items. `"file"` is `docs/BACKLOG.md`, or `docs/backlog/<label>.md` in a parallel/isolated run; `"github"` opts into one issue per item. GitHub is opt-in rather than the default because the host safety classifier refuses the *attempt* at external publication, so a Recorder that probes `gh` is ended before it writes the review report or architecture doc either — on `"file"` it is told not to run `gh` at all, not even to check availability. On `"github"`, a missing or refused `gh` falls back to the file and says so. An invalid value or unknown key is warned about and the default kept |
| `design.map` | *(unset)* | A list of `{ glob, doc }` pairs. When a run's changed files match `glob` and `doc` did not move with them, the document is reported as drifted — a `⚠` line and a backlog item, never a write. Reported in the Record phase only, so a `trivial` run or one rejected inside the fix loop reports nothing at all. Max 40 entries; a glob over 200 chars or 10 wildcards, or a `doc` that is absolute or carries `..`, is rejected with a warning |
| `planner.preferSplit` | `true` | Matches the preference for short atomic runs. `false` means "plan it as one piece, I know what I'm asking for", and the Planner then only flags a split when the task is outright incoherent as one run |

## Per-run override

Anything shown above can be overridden for one invocation:

```js
Workflow({name: "ldo:ldo", args: {
  task: "refactor the auth module",
  research: true,
  security: true,
  isolate: true,
  planOnly: true,
  config: {
    maxFixLoops: 5,
    models: { medium: { reviewer: "opus" } }
  }
}})
```

`isolate: true` and `planOnly: true` are both top-level args (like `research`/`security`, not `config` keys). `isolate` runs the task in its own git worktree instead of your working tree — same isolation a `tasks` batch gets, for a single feature. `planOnly` stops the pipeline early: Research → Plan → Security-if-elevated, then it stops and hands the plan back. The result carries `mode: 'plan-only'` and deliberately has no `approved` field, so a plan is never mistaken for a rejected run.

## Check it took effect

Run `/ldo:ldo` on something small and read the log line after Plan:

```
Complexity: medium  |  Security surface: none  |  Coder:sonnet  Reviewer:opus  Fix-review:opus
```

That's the routing that actually applied.

## Standalone calls

Agent files deliberately declare no model — this config is the only place routing lives. Calling `/ldo-coder` or `/ldo-reviewer` directly runs it on your session's current model. To pin one, use the workflow, or pass a model when invoking the agent.
