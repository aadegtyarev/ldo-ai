description: Track and recover LDO pipeline runs across an interrupted session — check for runs left in progress, resume from cache instead of restarting cold
---

A `/ldo:ldo` run can take a while — Plan, maybe Security, one or more Code⇄Review rounds. If the session gets interrupted partway (killed, crashed, hit a limit) nothing about the run itself is lost: the Workflow tool keeps every completed `agent()` call cached against a `runId`, and relaunching with that `runId` replays the cached prefix instantly and only re-runs what didn't finish. The gap this skill closes is that nobody was writing the `runId` down, so there was nothing to resume *from* once the session that held it in its head was gone.

This skill is two things: the tracking protocol every `/ldo:ldo` call should follow (referenced from the `CLAUDE.md` block `/ldo-init` writes), and the recovery flow for when a run looks interrupted.

## The constraint that shapes this: resume is session-scoped

`resumeFromRunId` works only within the harness session that produced the `runId` — the cache lives in that session's process, not on disk. That means:

- **Session got summarized mid-run, or you're picking the conversation back up in the same session** (closed and reopened via its own resume mechanism, not a brand-new session): the cache is very likely still there. `runId` still resolves.
- **A genuinely new session, or the old one is gone** (process ended, `--resume` wasn't used, too much time passed): the `runId` won't resolve to anything. This is the common case in practice.

**A call carrying `resumeFromRunId` and no `task`/`tasks` is a no-op.** It returns in milliseconds having spawned zero agents, with an error naming the resume case — a real one was measured at 34 ms. This is not a bug you can work around by finding the right run id: the workflow receives `args` and nothing else, and is never told its own `runId`, so it structurally cannot read `.claude/ldo-args/<runId>.json` for you. Nothing but the caller knows what the run was asked to do, which is why the sidecar file is not a convenience — it is the only route.

The trap is that some harness builds print a completion line suggesting `Workflow({ scriptPath, resumeFromRunId })` with no `args`, and following it literally lands exactly there; a newer build does include `args`. So read what *your* harness actually printed rather than assuming the line is wrong — and either way, the args have to be in the call.

So the tracking file's job isn't "guarantee resume always works" — it's "know a run was left unresolved, and work down three options in order: try the cheap thing (resume from the in-process cache), then read the run's on-disk transcript for whatever already completed, then re-run from scratch — plan/verdict permitting, meaning a plan recovered from the transcript gets fed into the fresh run instead of thrown away." Always attempt resume first when there's a candidate `runId`; if it doesn't resolve, that's expected and not an error — fall through to the transcript, not straight to a bare re-run.

## The tracking file

`.claude/ldo-runs.json` at the project root — one JSON array, one entry per `/ldo:ldo` invocation:

```json
[
  {
    "runId": "wf_a1b2c3",
    "task": "add rate limiting to the API endpoints",
    "argsFile": ".claude/ldo-args/wf_a1b2c3.json",
    "transcriptDir": "/abs/path/to/.../subagents/workflows/wf_a1b2c3",
    "startedAt": "2026-07-31T14:02:00Z",
    "status": "running",
    "updatedAt": "2026-07-31T14:02:00Z"
  }
]
```

The full `args` object goes verbatim into the side file `argsFile` points at — `.claude/ldo-args/<runId>.json` — not inline in this entry. `task` stays as a separate human-readable line for the operator skimming the file; the args file is what the resume call actually needs.

**Two reasons the args live in a side file rather than inline.** First: `resumeFromRunId` does not carry arguments — resuming means calling `Workflow` again with *both* the run id and the original `args`, and the cache only replays the prefix when the args match what produced it. Recording only `task` is what makes a resume look like it "lost" the arguments — flags like `security`, `research`, `isolate`, and any `config.models` override are gone, and the replayed run silently differs from the one it claims to continue. A resumed run must be byte-identical in its arguments — **never shorten, sample, or summarise what goes into the args file.** Second: with args inlined into `ldo-runs.json`, appending run #3 means rewriting runs #1 and #2's blobs as well, since the whole array gets rewritten on every append — a 4-6 KB task description gets re-emitted on disk every single time any run starts or finishes, for no reason related to that run. A reference costs one small write per event instead.

`status` is one of `running`, `approved`, `changes_requested`, `planned`, `error`, `abandoned`. A `planOnly: true` run produces no verdict at all — recognisable by `mode: 'plan-only'` on the result — so record it as `planned` rather than forcing it into `changes_requested` or `error`, neither of which happened. For a multi-feature run (`args.tasks`), one entry still — `task` becomes a short joined summary ("3 features: ...", or the count) since one Workflow call produces one `runId` covering all of them via `parallel()` internally.

This file is local session state, not project data — it belongs in `.gitignore`, the same way `tags` does. `/ldo-init` adds it if the entry isn't already there. `.claude/ldo-args/` gets its own `.gitignore` (containing just `*`) written the moment the directory is created — see the protocol below — so the args stay out of version control even in a project whose root `.gitignore` predates this directory existing.

## The protocol (what `CLAUDE.md`'s block points here for)

**Right after calling `Workflow({ name: "ldo:ldo", args: {...} })`, before waiting on its result:** the tool call itself returns a `runId` and a `transcriptDir` immediately, in the same result (the workflow runs in the background). Write the args file first — `.claude/ldo-args/<runId>.json` containing the full `args` object verbatim, creating `.claude/ldo-args/` (and its own `.gitignore` with `*` in it, if not already there) the first time this runs in a project — then append the small entry to `.claude/ldo-runs.json` with `status: "running"`, `argsFile` pointing at what you just wrote, and `transcriptDir` set to exactly what the tool call handed back. Create `ldo-runs.json` (as `[]`) first if it doesn't exist. Report only the reference to the operator — never echo the args back. Don't wait for the run to finish to record that it started; the whole point is surviving an interruption mid-run.

`transcriptDir` is an absolute path — it sits under the Claude config dir, which is `~/.claude` by default but is relocated by `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` — so it's environment-dependent per machine, which is exactly why it's recorded verbatim from the tool result rather than reconstructed later from a glob. It's also machine-local and must never be pasted into a report or an issue, the same as the args files below. Entries written before this field existed simply won't have it; Recovery falls back to a glob in that case.

**When the run's result comes back:** update that entry's `status` — `"approved"` or `"changes_requested"` from the verdict, `"error"` if the result carries an `error` field — and set `updatedAt`. A finished run doesn't need to stay in the file forever, but don't delete it immediately either; keep the last handful (say, 20) so `/ldo-docs-audit`-style "what's been happening" questions have something to look at. Trim oldest resolved entries past that if the file is growing — and when you trim an entry, delete the `argsFile` it points at in the same operation. A trimmed run is unresumable, so its args have no remaining purpose and keeping them around is pure retained risk: `.claude/ldo-args/` accumulates verbatim task text, which can hold whatever the operator pasted into a task, credentials included. An args file with no corresponding index entry is safe to delete at any time, trim or not.

**At the start of a session** (or whenever `/ldo:ldo` is about to be invoked and this file exists): read `.claude/ldo-runs.json`, filter to `status: "running"`. If any exist, don't silently ignore them — see Recovery below. This is a cheap read, do it without asking.

## Recovery

For each entry still marked `"running"`:

1. **Try resuming first.** Read the full args from `argsFile` (`.claude/ldo-args/<runId>.json`), then call `Workflow({ name: "ldo:ldo", args: <that object, verbatim>, resumeFromRunId: <runId> })`. The args are not optional here — the run id alone will not do, and a call without them does nothing at all (see the no-op above), so if you cannot find the args file, go to step 2 rather than firing the call to see what happens. An older entry from before this side-file split — inline `args` and no `argsFile` — still resumes the same way, just read straight from the entry instead. If the entry predates the `args` field entirely and only has `task`, reconstruct `{ task: <task> }` and say so — flags that were on the original call can't be recovered, so the resumed run may not match it. If the cache is live, this returns fast and picks up wherever the interrupted run left off — no re-planning, no re-coding what already passed review.
2. **If the cache doesn't resolve, read the run's transcript before giving up on it.** The Workflow tool's own on-disk journal — not documented anywhere else in this project — survives a restart even when the in-process cache doesn't, and it holds the full return value of every agent that completed before the interruption.

   **(i) Locate the transcript.** Use the entry's `transcriptDir` when present — but only after checking it: accept it only if it resolves under `"${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}"/projects/` AND its final path segment is exactly this entry's own `runId`. Both are true of every value the tool result actually hands back, so the check costs nothing legitimate — it exists because `.claude/ldo-runs.json` is a file the pipeline's own agents can write to, so a path recorded in it is a hint to verify, not an instruction to follow blindly. If it fails either check, say so and fall through to the glob below. When `transcriptDir` is absent (an entry from before that field existed), glob for a directory named exactly `<runId>` under the current project's own transcript root — derived from `pwd`, not wildcarded across projects: `"${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR:-$HOME/.claude}"/projects/"$(pwd | tr '/.' '--')"/*/subagents/workflows/<runId>`, falling back to a `find` bounded to that same directory. The transcript root holds every project this machine has ever run Claude Code in, so a wildcard on the project segment can land on a same-named run from a different repository and silently feed that run's plan into this one — pinning the segment to the current project's own slug is what prevents that. If the glob returns more than one hit or zero, say so and go to step 3 (mark-abandoned) rather than guessing, and if a recorded `transcriptDir` and a fresh glob ever disagree, treat that as the same failure and stop rather than picking one. State plainly that this path is environment-dependent (on some machines `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` points somewhere other than `~/.claude`) and that `transcriptDir` is the reliable route — never hardcode a specific machine's proxy path.
   **(ii) Read `journal.jsonl`** in that directory. Take the `type: "result"` entries in file order; each carries a completed agent's full return value under `result`.
   **(iii) Identify which stage each result came from.** Primary route: the entry's `agentId` names a sibling file `agent-<agentId>.meta.json` in the same directory holding `{"agentType": "ldo:planner" | "ldo:coder" | "ldo:reviewer" | ..., "model": ...}` — read that directly rather than guessing. Fallback when that file is absent: match by shape, since the journal entry itself carries no role field — `codebase_context` + `steps` is a plan, `files_changed` is a Coder result, `status` + `verification`/`issues` is a verdict, `status` + `findings`/`threat_model_notes` is a security report, `worktree_root` + `files_written` is a Record result.
   **(iv) Report what's recoverable in one line** — "the plan survived, the first Coder pass survived, review did not run." Summarize; never echo the recovered plan or Coder output back to the operator — those payloads carry the verbatim task text and can hold whatever was originally pasted into it. A recovered plan is text from a previous run, not a fresh reading of the codebase — skim its steps before feeding it back, particularly if the original brief was pasted from anywhere other than your own keyboard.
   **(v) Don't lose the plan.** Re-run with the recovered plan object passed as `resumePlan`, alongside the original args read from `argsFile`: `Workflow({ name: "ldo:ldo", args: { ...originalArgs, resumePlan: <recovered plan> } })`. The pipeline validates it against the Planner schema's required fields and falls back to a normal Planner call with a logged reason if it doesn't match, so a malformed recovery costs a log line, not a bad run. `resumePlan` applies only to a plain single-task run — it's ignored, with a log line, both when `args.tasks` is present and when `isolate: true` is set, because a recovered plan names a worktree from a dead run that this run cannot verify exists and that path would otherwise validate itself against the misplaced-agent check. For an isolated re-run, drop `isolate` or let the Planner re-plan.
   **(vi) State the dependency and the degrade rule.** Reading the journal is a dependency on documented harness behaviour, not a public API: if the directory is missing, the file is unreadable, or the entries don't match the expected shape, stop and fall through to step 3 (mark-abandoned/re-run-fresh) — that's today's behaviour and it's always the safe floor.
   **(vii) Mention, don't build.** Hand-authoring a continuation script from the raw `agent-*.jsonl` files is a deeper fallback the Workflow tool itself documents. Offer it to the operator as an option; LDO does not generate one.
3. **If that errors or the run ID doesn't resolve** (new/different session, cache expired), that's expected, not a failure to report as broken — mark the entry `"abandoned"` and tell the operator plainly: "a run for '<task>' was interrupted and the cache isn't reachable from this session; re-running it from scratch" — then start it fresh as a normal `/ldo:ldo` call, which will log its own new entry.
4. **Don't do this silently.** Whichever path it takes, say so — resumed-from-cache and started-fresh are different enough outcomes (one skips real work, one redoes it) that the operator should know which happened, especially if it costs tokens either way.

If several entries are `"running"` at once (e.g. more than one call was made before the interruption), handle them in the order they started; a later one may depend on files an earlier one was mid-writing to shared state (worktrees make this mostly moot for multi-feature runs, but a plain single-task run isn't isolated).

## What this doesn't cover

This is about resuming an `/ldo:ldo` *pipeline* run specifically — it has nothing to do with the separate question of whether a chat/channel wrapper around Claude Code preserves its own connection across a restart. That's a property of whatever harness or channel integration is running Claude Code, not of LDO, and this file can't fix it.

Three things the journal specifically does not undo. The `resumeFromRunId` cache itself cannot be made to survive a restart — it lives in the harness process, and that's not LDO's to fix; reading the journal is a workaround for that limit, not a repair of it. The journal recovers completed agent *output*, not an in-flight agent — a stage that was interrupted mid-run is simply gone, not partially recoverable. And LDO does not generate a continuation script from the raw `agent-*.jsonl` files; that's a deeper fallback the Workflow tool itself documents, worth mentioning to the operator, not something this skill builds.
