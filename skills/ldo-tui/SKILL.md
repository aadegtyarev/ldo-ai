description: Design and build terminal interfaces that earn the screen — keyboard-first, honest, degrading gracefully — in Textual (Python) or Ink (TypeScript)
---

A terminal is a small, scarce surface. Most of the time the right answer is a linear stream of text — a command with flags, not a full-screen interface. This skill is for the times that isn't true, when a 2D layout genuinely helps, and for making those not look like a web app wearing a costume.

Work in **Textual** (Python) or **Ink** (TypeScript/React). The principles are the same; only the primitives differ, and they're at the end.

## Decide the shape first

Before any layout, answer one question: **does this need to take over the screen at all?**

The strongest argument for restraint is accessibility. A screen reader consumes the terminal as a *stream* — text in, chronological. A full-screen TUI treats it as a *grid of cells* and redraws it, so the cursor jumps around and the reader hears fragments mixed together. For a blind user a well-designed linear CLI is not a compromise; it's faster and clearer than a "smart" TUI. Go full-screen only when the work is genuinely spatial: a list you navigate, a form, a dashboard of changing values.

When in doubt, build the stream version. It composes with pipes, scripts cleanly, and never traps anyone.

## Principles

### 1. Keyboard-first, and discoverable

The terminal's native input is the keyboard. Honour the conventions people already carry:

- `q` or `Esc` quits. `Ctrl+C` always.
- `?` shows help, `/` searches, `:` opens a command line if you have one.
- `j`/`k` or arrows scroll; `g`/`G` top and bottom; `Tab` moves focus; `Enter` selects.

Show the keybindings on screen, at least until the user is fluent. `?` is expected; a hidden keymap is a dead end.

### 2. Degrade in tiers, and respect the environment

Colour support is not uniform and you must not assume it. Build so each tier stands alone:

1. **Monochrome** — the tool is fully usable with no colour at all. Structure carries meaning: spacing, weight, characters.
2. **16 ANSI colours** — readable and correct everywhere.
3. **Truecolor** — the finishing layer, never load-bearing.

Then obey the signals. Respect `NO_COLOR`. Offer `--color=always|never|auto`. Detect whether `stdout` is a TTY, and when it isn't — piped, redirected, run by a script — emit plain text, no colour, no spinners, no boxes. A tool whose output only makes sense on a live terminal is one nobody can automate.

### 3. Density over chrome

Every border, every line of whitespace, every box-drawing frame is space a real value could have used. Terminals are small. Default to none of it; add a frame only when a region genuinely needs to be set apart. Two adjacent lists separated by a blank column reads better than two lists each wrapped in a box.

### 4. Don't lie with progress

A progress bar that stalls at 99% — because the real work is final verification you can't measure — is worse than no bar. If you can't compute honest progress, show a spinner, or a count (`47 files…`), or nothing. The research is clear that *perception* of progress can be engineered, but engineering it to look faster while it stalls is the lie this rule exists to stop.

### 5. Survive the environment

The terminal is hostile: it resizes, it runs inside `tmux` and `screen` and `ssh`, it's Windows Terminal or a Linux console with 8 colours. Re-render on `SIGWINCH`. Test inside a multiplexer. Use the alternate screen for full-screen apps and **restore it on exit** — including on crash — or you leave the user's scrollback destroyed. Test the wide-character and emoji case; it breaks layouts that counted columns.

## Anti-patterns (named, so you can spot them)

- **The terminal web-app** — borders, panels, widgets, gradients, trying to recreate a GUI. "The worst of both worlds: an inferior UI in an inferior rendering system." The reference is not your screen, it's `htop` and `lazygit` and the Unix tools.
- **Colour vomit** — every value a different hue with no system. Pick a small palette where colour *means* something: one for emphasis, one for warning, one muted. If red is both an error and a brand colour, you have no palette.
- **The lying progress bar** — a determinate bar for indeterminate work. See principle 4.
- **Undiscoverable keymaps** — power locked behind keys nobody told you about.
- **The required prompt** — an interactive question with no `--yes` / flag fallback, so the tool can't run in a script. Never require a prompt.
- **Broken on resize** — a layout that collapses or overlaps instead of reflowing.
- **Gradient and ASCII-art headings** — the "AI slop" look: purple-to-cyan title text, centered everything, decorative art. It reads as effort spent on appearance rather than the tool.
- **Full-screen redraw flicker** — repainting the whole frame each tick instead of the changed region.

## Process — two passes, with a critique between

**Pass 1: design before code.** Decide stream vs. full-screen. Sketch the layout in ASCII and write out the keymap and the palette — three colours at most, each with a job. Write the one sentence a first-time user reads on launch.

Then **critique it against the anti-pattern list above**, before writing anything. Be the skeptic: which of these is this design flirting with? A layout that survives the critique is worth building; one that doesn't usually means the stream version was right after all.

**Pass 2: build.** Follow the result. Test with the framework's test harness, then by hand inside `tmux`, at 40 columns, over `ssh`, with `NO_COLOR=1` set.

## Restraint

One signature element — a single interaction or visual choice that makes the tool memorable — and discipline everywhere else. The tool that does one thing well and gets out of the way is the one people keep.

## Framework notes

The principles above are framework-agnostic. When you build, the current primitives:

**Textual (Python)** — `App` subclass with a `compose()` generator yielding widgets; `textual.containers` (`Container`, `Horizontal`, `Vertical`) for layout; styling in a `.tcss` stylesheet (`CSS_PATH`) or inline (`CSS`), a real CSS dialect with grid; find widgets with `query_one` / `query`. Test headless with `Pilot` — `async with app.run_test() as pilot`, then `pilot.press(...)`, `pilot.click(...)`, `pilot.pause()`. Use `@work` for background tasks rather than raw `asyncio`. Type `compose() -> ComposeResult`.

**Ink (TypeScript/React)** — `render(<App/>)` from `ink`, React hooks from `react`. Every element is a flexbox `<Box>` (`flexDirection`, `justifyContent`, `alignItems`, `width`/`height`, `gap`). **All text must be inside `<Text>`; never nest a `<Box>` in a `<Text>`.** Keyboard via `useInput((input, key) => …)` where `key` carries `upArrow`, `return`, `escape`, `tab`, `backspace`. Quit with `exit()` from `useApp()`, or `Ctrl+C` (on by default). Test with `ink-testing-library` — `render(<App/>)` returns `lastFrame()` as a string. Use `<Static>` for output that scrolls above the live region.

For anything beyond the skeleton, the framework's own docs are the source — this skill is about taste, not an API reference, and an API reference here would be stale before it was useful.
